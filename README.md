# react-native-recycler-sectionlist

An alternative to react native's sectionlist component.

There is [no column support](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13192) for react native's SectionList and some solutions seems to present some performance issues. To mitigate those issues, I made a custom SectionList with [recyclerlistview](https://github.com/Flipkart/recyclerlistview) library and hopefully maintain all the APIs/Props of the original `<SectionList>` component to maintain familiarity and make migration painless.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-recycler-sectionlist

yarn add react-native-recycler-sectionlist
```

## Usage

None. Will do later.
